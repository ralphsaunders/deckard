__Deckard__: terminal command center for managing parallel Claude Code sessions via Git worktrees.

## About
Deckard is a worktree-native session manager for AI coding workflows.

It gives you a split-pane terminal UI showing:
- all active worktrees
- linked Claude sessions
- MR + CI status
- which tasks need human input right now

From one place, you can resume sessions, open MRs, monitor pipelines, and retire
work when it’s merged — without juggling terminal tabs or losing track of
parallel work.

Deckard turns your repo into an operations console for AI-assisted development.
